# Handbook of Hidden Data Scientist

*This is still work in progress!*

This is my handbook for data analysis, mining, cleaning, agregating, R and possibly data science. It has been written during taking the following courses on coursera prepared by [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.coursera.org/jhu).

* [The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/course/datascitoolbox)
* [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata)

Why "hidden" data scientest? It is inspired by [pioneer hidden scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkOCe58jReo).

If you are a developer able to write code in Java or similar language and work with databases, you might find this handbook useful and un-hide your data scientist potential.

Everything in this handbook is meant to be a quick learning material. There is no deep explanation of R language or anything else like that. But there are many examples with minimum information and many external references to study.
